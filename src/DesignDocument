Constructor:

public LinearEquation(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2)



Methods:

public String toString()
{
Returns String w/ coordinate points, slope, y intercept, slope intercept form equation of line, and distance between points
}

public double slope()
{
calculates slope of line from coordinates
}

public String equationSlope()
{
creates a better formatted slope for use in the equation
}

public double yIntercept()
{
calculates y intercept from coordinate and slope
}

public String equationYIntercept()
{
creates a better formatted y intercept for use in the equation
}

public String formEquation()
{
forms the equation by concatenating the y intercept string, the slope string, and other strings
}

public double distance()
{
calculates distance between the coordinates inputted
}

public String thirdCoordinate(int x3)
{
calculates the 3rd coordinate based on the inputted x value
}


EquationRunner.java

Step 1: Ask user to enter first coordinate point
Step 2: Assign coordinate point to a string variable
Step 3: Isolate x and y values from coordinate string
Step 4: Assign values of x and y to int variables
Step 5: Ask user to enter second coordinate point
Step 6: Assign coordinate point to a string variable
Step 7: Isolate x and y values from coordinate string
Step 8: Assign values of x and y to int variables
Step 9: Create LinearEquation object with inputted values
Step 10: Find slope, y intercept, and distance of LinearEquation object using slope, yIntercept, and distance methods
Step 11: Assign those values and the slope intercept form to a string variable using toString method
Step 12: Print that string
Step 13: Ask user to enter 3rd x coordinate
Step 14: Calculate the coordinate on the line with that x value and return as string
Step 15: Print that string
