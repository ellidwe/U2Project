Step 1: Ask user to enter first coordinate point
Step 2: Get coordinate as a string
Step 3: Find integer values for x and y in string
Step 4: Ask user to enter second coordinate point
Step 5: Find integer values for x and y in string
Step 6: Create LinearEquation object with inputted values
Step 7: Find slope, y intercept, and distance of LinearEquation object
Step 8: Return those values and the slope intercept form as a string
Step 9: Print that string
Step 10: Ask user to enter 3rd x coordinate
Step 11: Calculate the coordinate on the line with that x value and return as string
Step 12: Print that string
